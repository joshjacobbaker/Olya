React Query state stored on server and cached on client

I'll need fetch or axios with get, post, patch, delete actions

When I want to add an item I'll useMutation
When I want to get data I'll useQuery

I'll need a way to post data to Stripe
There's a stripe cli
there's a stripe hook
There's a stripe element library

Should I create a custom cart component or should I have Stripe component?
